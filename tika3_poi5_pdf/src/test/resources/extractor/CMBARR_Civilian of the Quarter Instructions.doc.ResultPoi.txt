CIVILIAN OF THE QUARTER AWARD
INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING NOMINATIONS

1.  DESCRIPTION OF AWARD

This award is designed to recognize a civilian employee for distinguished or extraordinary service to his/her organization and/or the base each calendar quarter.  The basis for the nomination is as follows:

a.  The performance or service being recognized must cover the entire calendar quarter.  A single short-term accomplishment is not a sufficient basis for this award.  Rather, performance or service during the entire quarter must be exceptional when measured against the position requirements and should far exceed contributions and service of others with comparable responsibilities. 

b.  Typical contributions of employees nominated for this award include unusual efforts or leadership in accomplishing work; contributions to improvement in organizational efficiencies; superior customer service; significant contributions to the public good; creativity and initiative in overcoming challenges and obstacles.

2.  NOMINATION PROCESS/RESPONSIBILITIES

    a. NOMINATING OFFICIAL 

  (1) The employee's first line supervisor will prepare the nomination using the form that follows these instructions and forward it through the supervisory chain to the Assistant Chief of Staff or activity director.

  (2) The union (AFGE, Local 1786) may also recommend an employee for this award by submitting a nomination to the first line supervisor, using the form that follows these instructions.  Such nomination must include the required written justification for the nomination.  The first line supervisor shall forward the award nomination, with an accompanying endorsement recommending approval/disapproval, through the supervisory chain, to the Assistant Chief of Staff or activity director. 

    b. ASSISTANT CHIEFS OF STAFF/ACTIVITY DIRECTORS

  (1) Assistant Chiefs of Staff and Activity Directors will carefully review each nomination received to determine which one nomination best meets the criteria for the award. 

  (2) Assistant Chiefs of Staff will forward the original plus four copies of the one nomination selected, to the Civilian Manpower Branch, AC/S G-1 MCCDC/MCB, with an appropriate endorsement.  

  (3) If the award nomination is ultimately approved by the Awards Committee, the Assistant Chief of Staff/activity director will be provided with a Certificate of Appreciation for presentation to the employee in an appropriate ceremony.  The Division Director/Commander will ensure that an RPA is prepared to process the $500.00 cash award and 32-hour time off award.  

3.  DEADLINE FOR NOMINATIONS.  Outstanding Civilian of the Quarter award nominations received after the deadline will be returned without action.
