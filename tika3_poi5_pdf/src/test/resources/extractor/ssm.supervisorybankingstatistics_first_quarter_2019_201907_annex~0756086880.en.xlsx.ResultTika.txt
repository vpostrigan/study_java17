Notes: Significant institutions at the highest level of consolidation for which common reporting (COREP) and financial reporting (FINREP) are available.
1) Only banks that are required to report liquidity information at the highest level of consolidation in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) are included in the liquidity coverage ratio calculations.
2) CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios are based on the transitional provisions laid down in Articles 465 to 491 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (the Capital Requirements Regulation).
3) The Level 1, 2 and 3 asset categories include only financial instruments measured at fair value.

Notes: Significant institutions at the highest level of consolidation for which common reporting (COREP) and financial reporting (FINREP) are available. The number of entities per reference period reflects changes resulting from amendments to the list of SIs following assessments by ECB Banking Supervision, which generally occur on an annual basis, and mergers and acquisitions.
1) There are no significant institutions at the highest level of consolidation in Slovakia.
2) G-SIBs: global systemically important banks. Data based on the last available list of G-SIBs as published by the Financial Stability Board.
3) Domestic exposures more than 95% of total debt securities and loans and advances.
4) Countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) not participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).
5) European countries not in the EEA.
6) RoW: rest of the world, i.e. all countries except European countries.
7) Risk-based classification using Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) results. Non-rated banks are those which have not been assigned a score in a specific SREP cycle, owing for example a recent change in significance, a merger or restructuring, etc. Classification as non-rated does not therefore necessarily indicate a high risk.
