Major Revenue + 
Beg. Fund Balances 
Property Taxes & Timber Revenues account for approx. 60% of the General Fund Rev.
A large amount is not received until October/November
Beg. Fund Balance must support the GF for the first 5 months
GFOA Best Practices recommends at a minimum, governments maintain unrestricted budgetary fund balance in their GF of no less than two months of regular GF operating expenditures.  
In addition to this, you must take into account your governments unique circumstances and may need to maintain a higher level of unrestricted fund balance. (i.e. natural disasters, volatile revenue sources such as Timber Revenues, cuts in state/federal funding).
