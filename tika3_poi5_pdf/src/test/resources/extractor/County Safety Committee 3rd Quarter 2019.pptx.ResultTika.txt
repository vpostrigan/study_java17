Claims Dashboard Project
This project brings all the claims data into a very visible format
It shows both Incident Rates and Claims Data
It shows trends over the past few years
It identifies job titles where the claims are occurring the most
Breaks down the claims within gender and age
The goal of this project is to utilize the claims data to help become more proactive, and to see  claims trends and identify  opportunities to reduce injuries.


Incident Rate
Incident rates are a metric used to compare a company’s safety performance against a national or state average. This comparison is a safety benchmark to gauge performance with other companies/state agencies in the same group.
The incident rate allows us to make an “apples to apples” comparison.

The formula is
Number of Injuries x 200,000/ total hours worked
200,000 = the annual hours worked for 100 employees (40 hrs/wk x 50 wks x 100)
