Students participating in Running Start programs are limited to a monthly combined enrollment of 1.20 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) except for the following instances. 

· When a student’s second high school trimester overlaps with the college fall quarter in December, the combined high school and college FTE can exceed 1.20 for December only.
· When a student’s first high school semester overlaps with the college winter quarter in January, the combined high school and college FTE can exceed 1.20 for January only.

In addition, a student’s annual average FTE (AAFTE) cannot exceed 1.20.  

As a result of your prior monthly enrollment and current schedule, you are projected to exceed the 1.20 AAFTE. As such, your available spring quarter Running Start FTE has been reduced to comply with the allowable maximum under state rules.  

The table below provides the calculation of this Running Start FTE reduction.

COMPLETING the SPRING QUARTER ELIGIBILITY ADJUSTMENT FORM (sqeaf)


PURPOSE

When a Running Start student is identified as at risk of exceeding the combined maximum annual average FTE (AAFTE) of 1.20, the high school counselor or registrar completes the SQEAF.  

This occurs for students who have been claimed for more than a 1.20 FTE in the months of December or January. 

· When a student’s second high school trimester overlaps with the college fall quarter in December, the combined high school and college FTE can exceed 1.20 for December only.
· When a student’s first high school semester overlaps with the college winter quarter in January, the combined high school and college FTE can exceed 1.20 for January only.

As a result of exceeding the 1.20 FTE, the student’s available spring quarter FTE is reduced.  

This form informs the student, parent/guardian, and college of the necessity to reduce the FTE available for the spring quarter.
