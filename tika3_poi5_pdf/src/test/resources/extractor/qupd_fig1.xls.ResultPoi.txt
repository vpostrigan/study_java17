Notes: The reported fourth quarter 2002 production amount was adjusted by rounding to the nearest 100,000 pounds to avoid disclosure of individual company data. This adjustment also affects the 2002 annual production. The reported production amounts in 2003 and the first, second, and fourth quarters of 2004 were adjusted by rounding to the nearest 200,000 pounds to avoid disclosure of individual company data.  The reported 2004 total is the actual production for 2004.  Second-quarter 2020 through second-quarter 2021 production was withheld due to confidentiality concerns. Totals may not equal the sum of components because of independent rounding.
